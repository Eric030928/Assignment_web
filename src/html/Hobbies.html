        <p class="P1">During high school, I was in the school band, 'Band 404'. In the band, I not only took the role of
            the band's
            lead singer, but also the role of the band leader at the same time. During my free time after school, I
            always rehearsed with my bandmates and enjoyed the joy of music. During my high school years, I led the band
            to
            perform in the Shenzhen High School Club Culture Festival and the "Friendship Train" Club Activity Show,
            which gained us a marvelous reputation both inside and outside the school. I also led the team to win the
            "Innovative Campus Culture Award at the First Shenzhen Campus Culture Festival 2020", the "Most Elegant Club
            Award", and a 1,000 RMB club fund in the Club Culture Festival.

        </p>
        <p>In addition, I joined the
            school's
            singing club, 'Boom Music Club', where I had a great time with my friends who also love singing. And, we
            also
            performed outside the school at the invitation of Shenzhen Radio and Television Station and received many
            praises.It is worth mentioning that because of my success in singing and club leadership, I was invited to
            speak in front of the whole school about my musical achievements as a "Club Champion".
            Until now, I still love singing, and I will enjoy the joy it brings in my free time outside the classroom.
