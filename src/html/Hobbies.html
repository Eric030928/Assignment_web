        <p class="P1">During high school, I was in the school band, 'Band 404'. In the band, I not only took the role of
            the band's
            lead singer, but also the role of the band leader at the same time. During my free time after school, I
            always rehearsed with my bandmates and enjoyed the joy of music. During my high school years, I led the band
            to
            perform in the Shenzhen High School Club Culture Festival and the "Friendship Train" Club Activity Show,
            which gained us a marvelous reputation both inside and outside the school. I also led the team to win the
            "Innovative Campus Culture Award at the First Shenzhen Campus Culture Festival 2020", the "Most Elegant Club
            Award", and a 1,000 RMB club fund in the Club Culture Festival.

        </p>
        <p class="P2">In addition, I joined the
            school's
            singing club, 'Boom Music Club', where I had a great time with my friends who also love singing. And, we
            also
            performed outside the school at the invitation of Shenzhen Radio and Television Station and received many
            praises.It is worth mentioning that because of my success in singing and club leadership, I was invited to
            speak in front of the whole school about my musical achievements as a "Club Champion".
            Until now, I still love singing, and I will enjoy the joy it brings in my free time outside the classroom.

        <p class="P3">I was born into a traditional Teochew family and I learnt my mother's Teochew cooking skills from
            a young age. From junior high school onwards, I learnt to chop, buy, cook and prepare various dishes under
            my mother's guidance. After high school, I spent my free time cooking for my family and trying to improve my
            cooking skills. In college, fortunately, I had the opportunity to express myself in front of my classmates,
            and on every weekend I would regularly cook for and eat with a few of my best friends. I really enjoy the
            feeling of accomplishment when I cook, from the raw ingredients that I start with individually, to the
            feeling of success when I put them together to burst with flavour. The pictures on the right are all photos
            of meals I cooked for my classmates during college.
        </p>
        <p class="P2">In order to develop my cooking skills, in addition to learning from my mother, I would look for
            posts about dishes on online communities such as "How do I make a delicious braised fish nugget?" . And, to
            improve my plating skills, I would also look for instructional videos from restaurant chefs to watch and
            learn. So far, my cooking has been well received by my family and friends, and I hope that I can keep up
            with this hobby and improve my cooking skills.

        <p class="P1">As the saying goes, "Read a thousand books and travel a thousand miles." Whenever I am on holiday,
            I always go out alone or with my family and friends. I have been to Auckland, Queenstown, Hohhot and other
            cities, and I always feel the beauty of the world every time I walk through a place. Apart from enjoying the
            beautiful scenery during the journey, I always meet and get to know all kinds of people on the road. Every
            time I travel, I enjoy it and I will continue to travel to other cities in the future to increase my
            knowledge.

        </p>
        <p class="P2">In addition to these three hobbies, I enjoy playing basketball, working out, and playing pool. For
            me, I think it's very important to have your own hobbies, which can help you rebuild your confidence quickly
            and release your stress when you are lost.
